# Touchdesigner Tox Exporter
A template repo used to externalize assets and export fully comntained tox files.

## Purpose
This project is incredibly heavily influenced by [Matthew Ragan's template tox repo](https://github.com/raganmd/touchdesigner-template-tox-dev). I wanted a version of it that was more of exactly what I wanted and it was easier for me to do so with a new repo rather than a fork.
